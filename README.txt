Description of Problem: Create a timed trivia game.

How you solved it: I solved it by creating a page with questions and choices with a countdown timer.

Technical approach: First I created the questions and choices. Then I created a timer that would start when you began the game. Up on choice selections, my if else statements will check the status of your choices to determine what you got wrong. It will then calculate your percentage correct and display that at the end of the game. If time runs out, all unanswered questions will be considered wrong and impact your score.
